				<h4>About:</h4>
				<p>This Android app can be used to learn a few words and phrases from the Miwok Native American language. I created this app while following along with a free online Android video course offered by Google on Udacity. Here's a link to the course that covered this app:</p>
				<p>Android Basics - Multiscreen Apps: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839">https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839</a></p>
				<p>Here is a full list of all the related Android courses in order; this is how I first got started learning how to make Android applications:</p>

				<p>If I hadn't created this app and shown it to my Android professor when I did, I probably wouldn't have been chosen to be the middleware role for the <a href="/flashcards">Flashcards</a> app; and therefore, wouldn't have been chosen as a Technical Architect for the <a href="/packpackmonsters">PackPackMonsters</a> app.</p>
				<p>I did make a few minor changes from the original instructions. One change was instead of putting the play image that they recommended next to each word, I used the â–º character. On Android, ImageViews store uncompressed images in memory, and I figured using the play character would be much more memory efficient. Another change was that I didn't include the code they recommended which would lower the volume of the app in the event that I receive a phone call while listening to a 1 second audio clip of a word being pronounced. It didn't seem necessary, but I can see how knowing how to do that would be useful for video/audio players.</p>
