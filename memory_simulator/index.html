				<h4>About:</h4>
				<p>I created this when I was a student at St. Joseph's College in an Operating Systems class. We were given the freedom to use any programming language we wanted to do this project, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>
				<h4>Assignment Details:</h4>
				<p><a href="MemMan2017.doc">Click here to download instructions</a></p>
				<h4>Features:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Support for First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit memory algorithms.</li>
					<li>The contents of the memory are displayed in a doughnut created with Chart.js.</li>
					<li>Viewing memory contents as a list is also possible.</li>
					<li>Capable of performing Compaction.</li>
					<li>Support for creating a process with a burst time in milliseconds.</li>
					<li>When there is no room for processes in memory, they can be added to the waiting queue.</li>
					<li>The user can view, rearrange, and delete processes on the waiting queue.</li>
					<li>Processes on the waiting queue are automatically added whenever a process is killed.</li>
					<li>The waiting queue uses a FIFO algorithm.</li>
					<li>Processes can be randomly created as well as randomly killed.</li>
					<li>It's also possible to kill all processes in memory.</li>
					<li>The processes in the doughnut can be recolored using a rainbow pattern.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>How data is structured:</h4>
					<p>I used 3 separate arrays called memoryLabels, memoryValues, and memoryColors to hold the data for the Memory Simulator. This was done so that the chart may be given reference pointers to these 3 arrays and to keep things less complicated by only having one copy of the data. The processes as well as the free memory blocks are stored on these 3 arrays.</p>
				<h4>Libraries used:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>jQuery 1.12.1</li>
					<li>jQuery UI 1.12.1</li>
					<li>jQuery Mousewheel plugin 3.1.12</li>
					<li>Chart.js 2.7.1</li>
				</ul>
