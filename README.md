This repo contains the source code for my website which showcases a few of my projects.

When I created my website, I decided I wanted to write it from scratch; without using any third party JavaScript libraries or frameworks.

[LessCSS](https://lesscss.org/) was used for the stylesheets.

The background image for my website is from here: [https://userstyles.org/styles/35345/stackoverflow-dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/35345/stackoverflow-dark)
