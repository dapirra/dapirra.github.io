				<h4>About:</h4>
				<p>This is an assignment I originally created while I was a student at Suffolk County Community College, but I have since taken some time to release a major update to it. This software would allow an adviser or a professor at Suffolk to keep track of student information. For extra credit, I made this program capable of reading and writing to a MySQL database. When I originally submitted this project, it was just below 2 thousand lines of code; now it's over 4 thousand, and it has a lot more features as well. Note that a MySQL server is required to save student data. <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XAMPP</a> was used for the development of this program, specifically <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/development/xampp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XAMPP Portable</a>, but WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP should work fine as well.</p>
				<h4>Features:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Reads and writes student information to a MySQL database.</li>
					<li>Any detail of a student can be searched for.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Regex search is also supported and can be enabled/disabled.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Columns can be sorted by any field.</li>
					<li>Random students can be generated for testing.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Students are generated with seeds and can be regenerated with the same seed if desired.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Can export all student information to a CSV file.</li>
				</ul>
