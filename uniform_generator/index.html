				<h4>About:</h4>
				<p>This program is something I created as volunteer work for a nonprofit organization called The 7th Calvary. The purpose of this program was to make the process of making uniforms for all their members easier. There are several thousand members, and not only does each member get a uniform, but the uniform also needs to be updated every time someone is promoted or earns a metal. Currently, this operation is done manually in photoshop by a team of people; but I thought it be a cool idea to write something to help make this process easier.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, this project ended up being cancelled. I still had a fun time creating a prototype nonetheless. How it works is the user is able to dynamically update the uniform's nametag, rank, and ribbons. The ribbons can also snap into place, be moved after being placed, and can be deleted by double clicking on them. Also, because these uniforms are being generated with a canvas element, it would have been possible for a lot of bandwidth and storage space to be saved as well, because the background image would be cached instead of the browser having to download a unique image every time. I also planned on making my program capable of importing and exporting the data used to create these uniforms as JSON strings that would contain the information needed to render the uniform, which could have been used to create an API later on.</p>
