				<h4>Backstory:</h4>
				<p>This program came into being because of a friend of mine who played on this military simulation server a lot. Something unique about this server in particular is that every player who joined received an image of their uniform hosted on their website. There have been several thousand people who have joined this server already. Not only do these images need to be created every time someone joins the server, they also need to be updated every time someone gets promoted or earns a metal. This operation is somehow done manually, in photoshop, by a team of people, which sounded crazy to me.</p>
				<p>I decided it would be an awesome project to write something to ease the process of making these uniforms, and volunteer some of my time so that I can save a lot of theirs. I spent a few days writing this sample program, which is basically a demonstration that was able to dynamically update the uniform's nametag, rank, and ribbons. The ribbons can also snap into place, be moved after being placed, and can be deleted by double clicking on them.</p>
				<p>Also, because these uniforms are being generated with a canvas element, it would have been possible for them to save a lot of bandwidth as well, because the background image would be reused instead of having to download a unique image every time. My solution would have also saved them a ton of storage space, because I'd planned on making my program capable of reading from and exporting simple JSON strings that would contain the information needed to render the uniform, which could be used for an API of sorts later on.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the person in charge of the creation of these uniforms viewed what I was doing as a waste of time, and that was the end of that. I still had a fun time creating this program nonetheless.</p>
