				<h4>About:</h4>
				<p>Pack Pack Monsters is an Android game intended to be a basic clone of Pokemon.</p>
				<h4>How it works:</h4>
				<p>When a match first begins, you and the Enemy AI will be given 3 monsters at random. To win, you must defeat all three of the enemy's monsters. The enemy's monsters are capable of using their ultimate ability multiple times while you are limited to using it once per monster; however, you are also allowed to use 1 of the 3 different power items during the match to assist you.</p>
				<p>Details regarding the different monsters can be found in the PackDex. Clicking on a monster's name in the PackDex will show more details about that monster. Details regarding the different power items can be viewed by pressing the 'Items' button on the main menu, while details regarding which elemental types are stronger/weaker against each other are seen by pressing the 'Help' button on the main menu. Win/Lose statistics can be viewed by pressing the hamburger menu icon on the main menu.</p>
				<h4>Backstory:</h4>
				<p>After my exceptional performance for the <a href="flashcards_app.html">Flashcards</a> project, I was chosen by the Professor to be a team leader for this assignment. Being in charge of a group of people was definitely a new experience for me; which I was initially apprehensive about. My responsibilities included coming up with solutions to problems that came up during the development of the project, leading the team of course, and meeting up with other members of the group to help them out when needed. Unfortunately, we didn't get as much time to work on this app as I would have liked, but the game does function, which is the important thing.</p>
				<h4>Challenges:</h4>
				<p>One interesting challenge making this project, was determining how the Enemy AI would operate. As the technical architect, I decided that the best solution would be to create an <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask">AsyncTask</a> for the enemy to make it's move. AsyncTasks are best suited to tasks that take a few seconds at most, and since the enemy only takes a little over 2 seconds to make a move, I determined it would be the best tool for the job.</p>
